# StopRugRemoval

Tired of having to pick up half your living room because you accidentally picked up the rug? So was I. This mod prevents you from being able to pick up a rug if there's something on it.

Configuration option `Enabled` works with Generic Mod Config Menu in case you want to temporarily disable the mod while playing.

Additionally: Allows placement of rugs outside, if `CanPlaceRugsOutside` is set to true. By default, you will not be able to plant on rugs, nor will grass spread on rugs. But there's a setting for that: `PreventPlantingOnRugs`

Additionally: Prevents you from removing items from tables unless the `FurniturePlacementKey` is held down. (Default is `LeftShift + Z`). You can disable this behavior by deselecting `PreventRemovalFromTable`.

Prevents gates from popping off if you hold right click near them (again, unless `FurniturePlacementKey` is held down.)

Installation: unzip and place in Mods folder. Uninstallation: simply delete from Mods folder.
